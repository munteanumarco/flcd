var x := 5 - Declares a variable x and initializes it to 5.
print x - Prints the value of x.
input x - Reads an integer input into the variable x.
for i = 1 to n - Basic for loop, where i starts at 1 and increments by 1 until n.
if (condition) then - Basic if condition.
end - Ends a block like a loop or condition.
